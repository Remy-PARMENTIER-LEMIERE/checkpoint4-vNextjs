# Checkpoint 4 reworked VERSION Nextjs

## About Old version

This is just a simple project with a CRUD that I've already done during formation's context at WildCode School with a Framework monorepo JS (React, Express, MySQL).

## The New version

This time it's done using Nextjs and the ORM Prisma to handle the MySQL queries.

Discovering Nextjs, I've been using some tools as Server Actions to handle forms, and some hooks I didn't know about like useActionState...

## Currently working on :
